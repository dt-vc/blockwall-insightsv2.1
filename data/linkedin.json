    "content": "Dear Founders, Investors, and Friends,\n\nThe crypto landscape is evolving rapidly, and three developments this week highlight why we're more committed than ever to backing bold Web3 builders.\n\nFirst, TRM Labs just hit a $1 billion valuation with a $70 million funding round. This isn't just a number, it's validation that institutional-grade compliance infrastructure is essential. As blockchain analytics tools become standard for financial institutions and law enforcement, the message is clear: trust and transparency drive adoption.\n\nSecond, the SEC has released new guidance on digital asset disclosure obligations. Clear rules create level playing fields and unlock institutional capital that was previously sidelined.\n\nThird, we're witnessing institutional players like Tian Ruixiang accepting Bitcoin as equity. This signals something profound: Bitcoin and digital assets are no longer speculative experiments, they're becoming core to how institutions allocate capital and structure deals.\n\nThe infrastructure is being built. The rules are becoming clearer. The capital is flowing.\n\nWhat problem are you solving in Web3 today?\n\n#Web3 #Crypto #Blockchain #CryptoVC",

    "content": "The crypto market just went through another stress test. Bitcoin dropped to $77K, $2.5B in liquidations, and yet here we are—still building, still investing.\n\nWhat this cycle has taught us: fundamentals matter more than ever. The projects that survive aren't the loudest—they're the ones with real users, real revenue, and real staying power.",
